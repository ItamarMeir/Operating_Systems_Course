/**
 * Function: my_fork (1)
 * -----------------
 * Calls fork() to create a new process.
 * 
 * If fork() succeeds (its return value is non-negative), 
 * the function returns the value returned by fork().
 * 
 * If fork() fails (its return value is negative), 
 * the function prints an error message and exits the process.
 * 
 * Returns:
 *  pid_t: The process ID of the child process to the parent, 
 *         and 0 to the child process.

/**
 * For each g=0, 1, ..., G, the function should print N^g lines in the following format:
 * My pid is p. My generation is g.
 * 
 * Where:
 *  - g is the generation of the process: the generation of the original (first) process is 0.
 *    If the generation of a process is i, then the generation of its child process is i+1.
 *  - p is the pid of the process which prints the line.
 * 
 * For instance, the line may be: My pid is 1038. My generation is 0.
 * 
 * Note that the pids are arbitrary, and are dependent upon the processesâ€™ scheduling on your machine.
 * In particular, the operating system may allocate a new process the same pid of an old terminated process.
 * The function should print its output to the file, whose file descriptor is the input fd.
 * 
 * Limitations and hints:
 *  - The function should use a single loop.
 *  - Each process iterates exactly N times over the loop.
 *  - Each process prints a single line.
 *  - Use my_fork(), not fork().
 *  - No prints nor calls to my_fork() are allowed outside the loop.
 *  - Each process should print its line only after all its children printed their lines.
